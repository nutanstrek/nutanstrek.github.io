Hi, I am Paras Sharma, currently a graduate student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Stony Brook University, NY, USA. I am mainly interested in researching galactic dynamics and understanding galactic phenomena with the help of simulations. This repository contains the code for my personal webpage, which will be updated yearly.
